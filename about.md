<p class="message">
  Jon maintains a strong passion for writing low level software with a focus on performance, expressiveness, and reliability. Modern software engineering is a collaborative effort, so supporting teams with ergonomic embedded tooling and libraries is top priority. He is just as eager to learn from incredible engineers as he is to share ideas, mentor, and collaborate.
  Lately, he has been enjoying refining his C++ abilities by catching up on major conferences, podcasts, and blogs. He then utilizes this knowledge to try and equip his coworkers with customizable, non-allocating equivalents of various standard library facilities, as well as the tools and knowledge to use them effectively.

Thanks for taking the time to visit! I try my best to share the useful and interesting programming and tooling techniques I've gathered in my travels in easily digestible, bite-sized pieces. It's my goal to make world class tooling for C++ accessible to the masses, so hopefully something here will be useful.
