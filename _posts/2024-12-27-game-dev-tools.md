Here is a list of all of the game development tools that I find interesting as an amateur.
Tools are organized into sections with brief explanations. Items are roughly sorted in
order of my personal preference. Additionally, some entries will have icons
next to them. The key is as follows:

- 💸 The tool in question has a monetary cost. They still may include free options.
- 🐣 I believe the tool in question is very good for beginners.
- ❗❗ The tool in question is more geared towards experienced users.
- ⏲ The tool is in beta - not ready for full use, but worth keeping tabs on.

# Development

Game Development can generally happen at 3 levels of abstraction:

- **Game Engines**, which contain integrated visual editors and are jam packed with
  tools out of the box.
- **Frameworks**, which are large, opinionated code libraries that help you rapidly
  code a game from scratch with basic functionality like graphics, audio, and basic
  networking
- **Libraries**, which are generally single purpose for a particular programming
  language. For example a game may opt to use a particular library specifically for
  loading png images from disk into a format usable by their game.

Fair warning that the lines between these can get blurry.
